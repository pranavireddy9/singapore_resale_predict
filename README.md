Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Prediction
Project Title: Singapore  Resale Flat Prices Predicting

Skills take away From This Project: Data Wrangling, EDA, Model Building, Model Deployment

Domain: Real Estate

Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict resale flat prices in Singapore. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical resale flat transactions from the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Once trained, the model will be deployed as a web application using Streamlit, which will allow users to input details of a flat and receive a prediction of its resale price.

Tasks:

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Selection and Training
Model Evaluation
Streamlit Web Application
Deployment on Render
Testing and Validation
Detailed Plan:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.
Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
This may involve removing outliers, missing values, and inconsistent formatting.
The data should also be split into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
For example, you could create a feature for the age of the flat or the distance to the nearest MRT station.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests).
Train the model on the training data.
You can use a variety of techniques to tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 Score.
Test the model on the held-out testing set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.
Streamlit Web Application:

Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat and receive a prediction of its resale price.
The web application should load the trained machine learning model and use it to make predictions.
Deployment on Render:

Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
Render is a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications.
Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
You can test the application by inputting different flat details and verifying that the predicted resale prices are reasonable.
Conclusion:

This project will provide you with valuable experience in data wrangling, EDA, model building, model deployment, and web development. You will also learn about the real estate market in Singapore.
